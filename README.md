# PCA projection

This repo provides a script to project GWAS participants into the same PCA space using the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) and the 1000 Genomes Project samples as reference. The codebase was originally developed at [covid19-hg/pca_projection](https://github.com/covid19-hg/pca_projection), but this repo is meant to serve as a shared codebase for different consortia and contains common scripts and documentations.
