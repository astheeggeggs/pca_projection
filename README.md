# PCA projection

This repo provides a script to project GWAS participants into the same PCA space using the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) and the 1000 Genomes Project samples as reference. Please refer to the step-by-step document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ahhw8Xp-rDiM2q3l--ONeMoLrpBFcxVT33F9YwQby0U/edit?usp=sharing).

I am shamelessly following the lead of GBMI here, and making small changes to their pipeline [here](https://github.com/globalbiobankmeta/pca_projection/tree/master)
